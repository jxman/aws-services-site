## üìù Recent Updates

### November 1, 2025 - UX Bug Fix: Recent Changes Count
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Impact:** User Experience

**Problem:**
- "Recent Changes" displayed "4 total" but showed 9+ individual change items
- Count represented changelog entries (snapshots) instead of actual displayed items
- Caused user confusion about what the number meant
- Mobile version had the same issue

**Solution:**
- Added `countTotalChanges()` helper function to count individual change items
- Updated both desktop and mobile views to show accurate counts
- Each line displayed = 1 count (new service, regional expansion, or new region)
- Regional expansions grouped by service (matching display logic)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/whatsNewHelpers.js` - Added counting function
- `src/components/whats-new/ContentContainer.jsx` - Updated desktop count logic
- `src/views/WhatsNew.jsx` - Updated mobile tab count logic

**Result:**
- Count now matches visual display exactly
- Consistent counting across desktop and mobile
- Improved user clarity and trust in the interface
